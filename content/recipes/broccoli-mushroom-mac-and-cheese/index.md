yield: 4
prepTime: 15
cookTime: 45

ingredients:
- 150 ml almond milk
- 2 cloves garlic
- 4 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tsp pepper
- 1 pack vegan cheddar slices
- 2 tbsp breadcrumbs
- 200 grams macaroni
- 110 grams vegan butter, 85 for the sauce, 25 for the topping
- 1 small head of broccoli
- 1 box button mushrooms

directions:
- Preheat oven to 200˚C.
- Cook your pasta al dente. Drain, rinse with cold water (to prevent the pasta from sticking together) and set aside.
- Chop up the garlic into tiny pieces. Add the butter, garlic and lemon juice to a pan. Stir until the butter is melted.
- Add the heavy cream and pepper. Stir to combine and let it come to a simmer.
- Once the sauce is simmering, start to slowly add your cheddar slices. Make sure to stir until melted. Vegan cheese can make the sauce have a weird texture if you add to much, but not enough flavor if too little is added. Taste it along the way to make sure everything is to your liking. Turn the heat down.
- Put a bit of olive oil in a pan and cook your mushrooms and broccoli until they’re tender but not too soft.
- Mix the pasta and broccoli mushroom mix into your sauce. Add salt and pepper to taste, then pour the mixture into an ovensafe dish.
- Melt your vegan butter in a small bowl. Once it cools down a bit, add the breadcrumbs and mix together.
- Add the crumb mixture to the top of your mac and cheese. Optionally top with some paprika.
- Bake for about 20 to 25 minutes, let cool and enjoy!
