ingredients:
- 1 block tofu
- 80 ml soy sauce for sauce
- 2 tsp soy sauce for tofu
- 2 tsp black pepper
- 1 tsp white wine vinegar
- 1 tsp ginger powder
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 4 tbsp brown sugar
- 1 tbsp cornstarch for sauce
- 2 tsp cornstarch for tofu
- 160 ml water for sauce
- 60 ml water for mixing with cornstarch
- 4 dl water for rice
- 2 garlic cloves
- 2 tsp olive oil for tofu
- 2 dl basmati rice
- 1 head broccoli

directions:
- Press your tofu for 30 minutes and cut it into bite sized pieces. Cut your broccoli into small florets.
- Preheat oven to 215˚C and coat a baking sheet with cooking spray, or use baking paper.
- Toss tofu with olive oil, soy sauce, cornstarch, and black pepper. Organize tofu on the baking sheet so no pieces are touching, then bake for 30 minutes, flipping once halfway through.
- While the tofu is in the oven, mince your garlic and brown in a sauce pan for a couple minutes.
- Add the soy sauce, water, vinegar, ginger powder, sesame oil and brown sugar. Bring the heat up while stirring.
- Mix the cornstarch and water, then add to the sauce. Bring sauce to a boil and allow to boil for about a minute. Cool down and taste. Adjust soy sauce/brown sugar levels as desired.
- Once your tofu is done, toss it in the sauce and set aside.
- Toss your broccoli florets with some olive oil, salt, and pepper. Bake for 20 minutes, flipping halfway through.
- While the broccoli is in the oven, add the rice and water into a pan and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat, and let simmer with a lid on for 15 minutes, then take off the heat and let rest for another 5.
- Serve the tofu and broccoli on top of the rice and enjoy.
