ingredients:
4 tbsp tahini
2 tbsp olive oil (plus more for garnishing)

2 tbsp lemon juice
4 tbsp water
0.25 tsp salt

directions:
- In a food processor, combine the tahini and olive oil and pulse until smooth.
- Add the garlic, chickpeas, lemon juice, water and salt. Process until smooth. The longer you process in the food processor, the smoother the hummus will be. Add more salt or lemon juice to taste.

Love hummus? It's so easy to make your own! Homemade hummus only takes 5 minutes, and it's so much better than store-bought. All you need are a few cans of chickpeas, some tahini, olive oil, some seasonings, and a food processor.
