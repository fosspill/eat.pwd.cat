cookTime: 25

components:
- Cream Cheese Frosting

ingredients:
- 4 medium carrots to make 300 grams grated
- 125 ml vegetable oil
- 175 grams light brown sugar
- 2 tsp vanilla essence
- 300 ml almond milk
- 375 grams all purpose flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1.5 tsp baking soda
- 2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1 tsp ground nutmeg
- 1 tsp ground ginger
- 0.5 tsp salt
- 70 grams walnuts, chopped
- chopped walnuts to decorate

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 180C. Grease and line 2 x 20cm round cake pans.
- Peel and grate the carrots and set aside. 
- In a large bowl, whisk the oil, sugar and vanilla for a few minutes until the sugar starts to dissolve, then stir in the milk. 
- Sift in the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and salt and gently combine. Stir in the walnuts and grated carrot.
- Divide the batter between the two baking pans and bake in the oven for 25 minutes or until an inserted skewer or toothpick comes out clean. This is a perfect time to make the cream cheese frosting.
- Allow to cool in the tins for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
- Spread half of the cream cheese frosting onto the bottom layer, add the top layer and frost the top with the remaining frosting. Sprinkle the top with chopped walnuts.
