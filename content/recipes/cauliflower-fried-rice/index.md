yield: 2
prepTime: 15
cookTime: 10

ingredients:
- 1 head cauliflower, cut into florets
- 3 tbsp sesame oil
- 1 large onion
- 150 grams frozen peas
- 2 carrots, chopped
- 4 tbsp soy sauce
- salt to taste

directions:
- In 2-3 batches, use your food processor to “pulse” the florets. You don’t want to over-pulse it, because you want it to have that grainy-rice texture. Place into a bowl and set aside.
- Over medium heat, add sesame oil, onion, peas, and carrots. Sauté until cooked.
- Add your cauliflower rice to the mix and add your soy sauce – mix and cook over med heat – stirring frequently.
- Taste to see if extra salt is needed, and serve!

The beauty of cauliflower fried rice is the fact that you are eating all veggies even though it feels like a grain. Seasoned with Asian flavors and packed with vegetables, you can eat as much fried “rice” as you want because it is guilt-free!
