- 3 bananas (very ripe)
- 60 ml oil
- 150 grams sugar

- 1 tsp baking powder

- Carefully spoon the batter into your lightly greased or lined muffin tin, filling each well about 2/3 full. If desired, sprinkle sugar on top just before baking.
- Bake the muffins in the heated oven for about 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into a muffin comes out clean. Eat while still warm or cool completely for longer storage.
