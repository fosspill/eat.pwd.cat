yield: 4
prepTime: 45
cookTime: 10

ingredients:
- 1 medium sweet potato
- 1 small onion, quartered
- 3 garlic cloves
- 170 grams cooked or canned chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- 60 grams breadcrumbs
- 4 tbsp chickpea flour
- 2 tbsp dried coriander
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 2 tsp cumin
- 0.5 tsp salt
- 0.25 tsp pepper

directions:
- Preheat oven to 200ËšC. Scrub sweet potato and puncture several times with a knife. Bake until easily pierced with a knife, about 35 minutes. You want it to be slightly firmer than if you were going to eat it like a baked potato. Remove from oven, cut open and allow to cool.
- Scoop sweet potato insides into food processor bowl and add onion, garlic, chickpeas, breadcrumbs, chickpea flour, cilantro, lemon juice, olive oil, cumin, coriander, salt and pepper. Pulse until chickpeas are well chopped and ingredients are incorporated, stopping to scrape down sides of bowl as needed.
- Test a bit of the mixture by pressing it together with your hands. If it doesn't quite hold together, transfer mixture to a bowl, cover, and refrigerate at least 30 minutes.
- Shape the sweet potato mixture into 4 patties.
- Coat a large skillet oil and place over medium heat. Working in batches if needed, place patties into skillet and cook until browned on bottoms, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on opposite sides, about 5 minutes more.
- Serve with your favorite burger/falafel toppings.
