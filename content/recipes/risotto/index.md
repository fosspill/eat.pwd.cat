prepTime: 10
cookTime: 25

ingredients:
- 0.5 onion, chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 200 grams mushrooms, sliced
- 0.5 Carrot, peeled and cubed
- 160 grams rice
- 50 ml apple cider vinegar
- 1 l vegetable stock
- 5 grams frozen peas
- 10 grams vegan butter

directions:
- Heat some oil in a large pan and sauté the onion and garlic until the onion is soft.
- Then add in the mushrooms and carrot, sauté until the mushrooms are soft but not completely cooked. You might need to ad in a little bit of water (or vegetable stock) to make sure the ingredients aren't sticking to the bottom of the pan.
- Add in the rice and stir through for a minute. Add in the vinegar and stir until the rice has absorbed all or most of the liquid.
- Start adding the stock, one ladle at a time. Make sure all or most of the liquid is absorbed by the rice before adding the next ladle of stock.
- Stir occasionally, but not constantly. to make sure nothing sticks to the bottom or sides of the pan.
- You have to taste the risotto after about 15 minutes to see if the rice is cooked. If it is, turn the heat to the lowest setting and add in a ladle of stock and the frozen peas. Also add in a pinch of salt and pepper, and the vegan butter.
- Stir through until the vegan butter has melted and made the risotto nice and creamy. Turn off the heat and serve immediately.
