components:
- Cucumber and Carrot Slaw
- Asian Guacamole

ingredients:
- 2 portobello mushrooms
- 1 tbsp miso
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 1 tbsp sriracha
- salt and pepper
- 2 whole wheat buns

directions:
- Preheat the grill. Using a fork or mini whisk, mix the miso, siracha and sesame oil & a pinch of salt and pepper together in a small bowl to make a paste. Brush liberally onto both sides of the portobello mushrooms.
- Grill the portobellos, top sides down first, for 4-5 minutes over medium heat, until juicy and tender. Flip, grill a few more minutes. Grill the buns.
- Assemble the burgers. Spread buns with generous amount of Asian Guac, place the portobello- gills side up ( to catch all the flavorful juices) then mound with cucumber ribbon and carrot salad and a little squeeze of sriracha. Use the remaining Asian Guac on the bun tops, and top the burgers.
- Eat immediately.
