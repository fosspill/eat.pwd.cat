prepTime: 10

ingredients:
- 180 grams rice noodles
- 250 grams block tofu, drained
- 0.5 tsp turmeric
- 0.5 tsp Kala Namak (black salt)
- 160 ml vegetable broth
- 3 tbsp coconut sugar
- 2 tbsp tamari/soy sauce
- 2 tbsp sriracha
- 1 tbsp cornstarch
- 3 tbsp Water
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 red bell pepper, sliced
- 4 spring onions, white and green parts separated
- 1 carrot, grated
- 100 grams bean sprouts (optional)
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- chopped peanuts for garnish


directions:
- Use your hands to crumble the block of tofu into a small bowl. Add in the turmeric and stir well. Set aside.
- Prepare the noodles. Bring a medium pot filled with water to a boil, then cook the noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.
- While the noodles are cooking, add a splash of water or oil to a large saucepan. Add the crumbled tofu to the pan and cook over medium heat for 3-5 minutes. Sprinkle in the black salt at the end, then remove from the pan and set aside.
- Using the same pan, add an additional splash of water or oil to the pan along with the garlic and white portions of the spring onions. Sauté over medium heat until translucent, about 3 minutes.
- Next, add in the bell pepper and carrot. Sauté again until tender, about 3-5 minutes.
- Add the vegetable broth, coconut sugar, tamari, and sriracha to the pan and mix well. Bring this mixture to a simmer.
- In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch and water together until no clumps remain. Then, pour this “slurry” into the saucepan and mix into the sauce. Let the veggies and sauce simmer for a few minutes, until the sauce begins to thicken noticeably.
- Once the sauce has thickened, add in the bean sprouts, green portions of the spring onions, tofu, and cooked noodles. Mix well until everything is heated and coated in sauce.
- Finally, stir in the lemon juice. Divide the Pad Thai evenly onto 2 plates, and top chopped peanuts.
