yield: 12
prepTime: 25
cookTime: 5

ingredients:
- 200 grams oatmeal
- 50 grams puffed rice
- 185 grams nut butter
- 200 ml liquid sweetener (maple, agave, date...)
- 50 grams coconut sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract (optional)

directions:
- Preheat oven to 180˚C and line a 22x22cm baking tin with parchment paper.
- Add the oats and rice cereal to a large bowl and mix until evenly combined.
- Add the nut butter, liquid sweetener, coconut sugar, and vanilla extract to a separate, smaller bowl. Microwave for 20 – 30 seconds to loosen the mixture, then stir until well-combined.
- Pour the wet mixture into the bowl of dry ingredients and use a spatula to mix everything together. You may eventually need to use your hands to really get in there.
- Fold in any additional toppings or bar flavors, if you are using them. Firmly press the granola bar mixture into the lined baking tin, then bake in the middle rack of the oven for 6 to 8 minutes. Remove the tin from the oven and let cool completely before removing and slicing into bars.
- Serve as desired; leftovers will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for up to one week.
