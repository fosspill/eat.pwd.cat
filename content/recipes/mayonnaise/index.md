cookTime: 

ingredients:
- 250 ml sunflower oil
- 125 ml unsweetened soy milk 
- 2 tsp apple cider vinegar
- 0.5 tsp salt

directions:
- Make sure the oil is at the same temperature as the milk. You can use cold oil and cold milk, but  room temperature milk and oil is recommended.
- If you’re using an immersion blender, combine all the ingredients in the blender cup, place the immersion blender in, so that way it sits firmly on the bottom of the cup and pulse until the mayo emulsifies. Once most of the vegan mayo has emulsified, you can move the blender up and down to incorporate any oil that is sitting on the top.
- If you’re using a regular blender, place all the ingredients in the blender, except the oil, and blend for about 5 seconds. Then add the oil gradually while the blender is going at a slow speed until it thickens, then you can turn it gradually from low to high and let it go until well mixed.
- Try the mayo and add more salt if needed. If it’s too thick, add more milk and if it’s too watery add more oil. Pulse again until the mayo has the perfect consistency.
- Use it immediately or keep it in the fridge for a few hours until it’s cold. Keep lefovers in an airtight container or a jar in the fridge for about 4-7 days.
