ingredients:
- 3 tbsp aquafaba
- 180 ml sunflower oil 
- 1 tsp white vinegar
- 1.5 tsp lemon juice
- 0.25 tsp black salt
- 0.5 tsp dijon mustard

directions:
- Combine all ingredients except for the oil in a blender or food processor. Blend briefly just to mix the ingredients.
- While blending on medium-high speed (or pulsing with a food processor), slowly add the oil in a thin, steady stream until completely incorporated. The mixture will thicken quickly within a few minutes.
- This vegan mayonnaise is fairly light tasting and meant to be a blank canvas. Feel free to increase the amount of vinegar or lemon juice for more tang, add salt, or add other seasonings to your preference.
- Transfer to clean jar and store in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.

Aquafaba mayo is super simple and easy to make. This vegan recipe produces a classic mayonnaise that is thick, creamy, slightly tangy and simply perfect for all your sandwich needs. The ingredients are basically the same as with a normal mayonnaise recipe, except we replace the traditional egg with aquafaba and a sprinkle of eggy-tasting black salt.
