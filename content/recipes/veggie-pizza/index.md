ingredients:
- pizza sauce of choice
- pizza toppings of choice
- 250 g flour
- 0.75 tsp salt
- 0.75 tbsp yeast
- 1.5 tbsp olive oil
- 190 ml warm water

directions:
- Add flour, salt and yeast to a food processor with the blade attachment. Pulse until well mixed.
- Pulse in olive oil.
- Turn machine to the on position and while running pour in warm water. Let machine run until dough pulls away from the edges and forms a ball.
- Put dough in a greased bowl and cover. Let rise until doubled in size.
- Use a bit of flour to spread the dough into an oval. Spread it depending on on how thick or thin you want the crust to be. Keep the edges thicker than the center. Let it sit for a few minutes. Preheat the oven to 230Âºc.
- Spread the pizza sauce on the crust. Distribute your toppings evenly.
- Sprinkle meltable vegan cheese on the toppings if using at this point.
- Bake the pizza for 17-18 minutes or until golden on the edges. Sprinkle parmesan on top if using, slice and serve!
