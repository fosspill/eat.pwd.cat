ingredients:
- 115 grams vegan margarine
- 225 grams vegan cream cheese
- 2 tsp lemon juice
- 1 tsp vanilla
- 400 grams powdered icing sugar

directions:
- Beat softened vegan butter and dairy free cream cheese together with an electric mixer for a few minutes until smooth and fluffy, then beat in the lemon juice. 
- Sift in the powdered sugar, 50 grams at a time, beating well before adding more. 
- Add the vanilla and beat for a few minutes until smooth and fluffy. If it's starting to go runny, stop and put it in the fridge to firm up. 
- Different types of vegan cream cheese react differently, so adjust the amount of powdered sugar needed until you get a nice thick consistency. Taste and add more lemon juice if desired.
- Keep in the fridge until ready to frost completely cooled cake or cupcakes. Once frosted, keep cakes or cupcakes in the fridge.
